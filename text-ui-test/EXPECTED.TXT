Let's get this over with. What do you want?

Fine. I'll add 'garfield.tasks 1' to the list.

        [T][ ] garfield.tasks 1

Just what you needed to boost your list to a grand total of 1 garfield.tasks. Lucky you.

Fine. I'll add 'garfield.tasks 2' to the list.

        [D][ ] garfield.tasks 2 (by: Sunday)

Now your list is up to 2 tasks. Because who doesn't love more deadlines.

Fine. I'll add 'garfield.tasks 3 ' to the list.

        [E][ ] garfield.tasks 3 (from: Today to: next week)

Your list is now at 3 tasks. Maybe you'll get around to actually doing them.

Nice. You actually did something. I've marked that garfield.tasks as done:

        [T][X] garfield.tasks 1

______________________________________________________________________
Oh, having second thoughts? OK, I've marked that garfield.tasks as not done yet:

        [T][ ] garfield.tasks 1

Clearly, you're still undecided.

Ugh, here's what you've got so far:

1. [T][ ] garfield.tasks 1
2. [D][X] garfield.tasks 2 (by: Sunday)
3. [E][ ] garfield.tasks 3 (from: Today to: next week)

Can we be done now?
