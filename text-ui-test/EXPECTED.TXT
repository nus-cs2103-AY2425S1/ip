Hello! I'm Duck.
What can I do for you, QUACK?

Here are the tasks in your list:

Hey, that's not a valid instruction! I don't know how to respond to that.

Got it. I've added this task:
[T][ ] test
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.

Got it. I've added this task:
[D][ ] test1(by: Sep 17 2021 18:00)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.

Hey, a deadline instruction should be of the following format:
deadline {description} /by {deadline}
{deadline} should be in the format yyyy-mm-dd HHmm OR yyyy/mm/dd HHmm

 Invalid date format following the command /from /to /by!
 Please use one of the following formats:
 yyyy-MM-dd HHmm or yyyy/MM/dd HHmm

Got it. I've added this task:
[E][ ] test3(from: Sep 17 2021 18:00 to: Sep 17 2021 18:01)
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.

Give me a valid event format!
event {description} /from {start} /to {end}
{start}: yyyy-mm-dd HHmm OR yyyy/mm/dd HHmm
{end}: yyyy-mm-dd HHmm OR yyyy/mm/dd HHmm

The end time of an event should be after the start time!

Update tasks with correct format please >:(
mark/unmark {index of task to update}
Oops! Index out of bound :( Input a valid task index.

Nice! I've marked this task as done:
