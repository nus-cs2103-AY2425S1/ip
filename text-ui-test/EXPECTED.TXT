    Hey there! I'm Regina
    I am a chatbot designed to help you track your activities.
    You can add tasks using the following formats:
    1. To add a To-Do task: todo <task_description>
       Example: todo Finish homework
    2. To add a Deadline task: deadline <task_description> /by <deadline>
       Example: deadline Submit report /by Sunday
    3. To add an Event task: event <task_description> /from <start_time> /to <end_time>
       Example: event Team meeting /from Mon 2pm /to 4pm
    In case you forget, type 'help' to be reminded of the formats again!
    So how can I help you?
