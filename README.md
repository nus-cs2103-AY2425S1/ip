Example command: `todo read book /priority low`

### Adding Deadlines: `deadline`

To add a new deadline task, use the command

`deadline (name of task) /by YYYY-MM-DD HHMM /priority (high/medium/low)`

Ensure that the date is of the correct format of Year-Month-Day and the time is in 24 hour time. 

Example command: `deadline submit work /by 2024-09-20 1800 /priority high` 


### Adding Events: `event`

To add a new event, use the command 

`event (name of event) /from YYYY-MM-DD HHMM /to YYYY-MM-DD HHMM /priority (low/medium/high)`

Ensure that the date is of the correct format of Year-Month-Day and the time is in 24 hour time.

### Marking tasks as completed: `mark`
To mark a task as completed, use the `mark (index of task)` command. Ensure to correctly input the task of the index 
you would like to mark as completed. 

### Marking tasks as incomplete: `unmark`
By default, all tasks added to the task list are unmarked. However, if you had previously marked 
a task as complete that you would now like to mark as incomplete, you can do so via the 
`unmark (index of task)` command. Ensure to correctly input the task of the index you would like to 
mark as incomplete. 

### Searching for tasks by keyword: `find` 
To search for tasks that contain specific keywords, use the command
`find (keyword)`.

This will generate a list of tasks in your current task list that contain the keyword.

### Searching for tasks by priority: `priority`
To obtain a list of all existing tasks of a certain priority, use the command 
`priority (high/medium/low)`. 

This will generate a list of tasks in your current task list that have the specified priority.


### Deleting tasks: `delete`
To delete a particular task, use the command `delete (index of task)`, ensuring that you key in 
the index of the task in your existing task list to be deleted.


### Closing the app and Saving your tasks: `bye` 
**This step is important to ensure your tasks are properly saved in your task list!**

Use the command `bye` before exiting the app to ensure your tasks are saved.
