## Code snippets

You might encounter a significant amount of frustration when using the app since it is currently 100% text based which could lead to suboptimal user experience. To worsen this experience, create and run a file names `Main.java` with the following code:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"java", "-cp", System.getProperty("java.class.path"), "Main"});
	}
}
```
