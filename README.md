### Mark/Unmark a Task
To mark a task as complete, type `mark {task_number}`. For example, `mark 1` will mark task 1 as complete. Conversely, to unmark a task as incomplete, type `unmark {task_number}`. For example, `unmark 2` will mark task 2 as incomplete. Note that tasks are indexed starting from 1.

For example, you can do this to mark the first task as complete.
```bash
mark 1
```
