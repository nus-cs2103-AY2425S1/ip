## acknowledgements

i used chatGPT to help me write the unit tests in AAA format. I also used chatGPT to help me figure out how to 
use javaFX, so it is likely the gui code is influenced. In places such as `Wojak.java`, `OutputHandler.java`.

I also reused the [AB3 user guide](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html)

The pictures, I took them myself, so I will acknowledge myself.
