## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have Java `17` or higher installed on your computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [this link](https://github.com/chongtzezhao/ip/releases).

3. Move the `.jar` file to the folder where you want to store your chatbot's _home folder_.

4. Open a command terminal, navigate to the folder containing the `.jar` file, and run the application using the command:
   ```
   java -jar atlas.jar
   ```

   A graphical user interface (GUI) similar to the one shown below will appear after a few seconds.

5. Enter a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, typing **`list`** and pressing Enter will display the list menu.
   
   Here are some example commands you can try:

    - `list`: Displays all tasks.

    - `delete 2`: Removes the 2nd task listed in the current display.

    - `bye`: Closes the application.
