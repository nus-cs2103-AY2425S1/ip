# Kat project template

This is a greenfield Java project based on [this project template](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/ip). It's named after _Kat_ now (Before, it was named after the Java mascot _Duke_). Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 17, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 17** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
3. After that, locate the `src/main/java/chatbot/Main.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Main.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
   ```
   Hello from
    _         _   
   | | __ ___| |_
   | |/ / _  | __|
   |   < (_| | |_
   |_|\_\____|\__|
   ```
