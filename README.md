## ðŸ¤– Special Acknowledgment for GitHub Copilot

Throughout the development of this project, GitHub Copilot was used for code autofill and suggestions.

For example:
- The `Deadline` class was coded manually, but the `Event` class has similarities due to Copilot's autofill suggestions.
- Many command classes, such as `TodoCommand`, `DeadlineCommand`, and `EventCommand`, were generated with significant help from Copilot.

This extensive use of AI assistance has helped streamline the development process, but it also means that large segments of the code are AI-generated and might resemble code from other projects.
