## Features

### Command Format
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    - Example: In `todo TASK_DESCRIPTION`, `TASK_DESCRIPTION` is a parameter to be provided by the user.
- Items in square brackets `[ ]` are optional.
    - Example: `deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION /by DATE` can be used with an optional date.
- Parameters can be in any order.
    - Example: `event TASK_DESCRIPTION /from DATE /to DATE` is valid even if `/to DATE` and `/from DATE` are switched.
