## Saving and Editing Data

- **Data is saved automatically** after every command that modifies the task list.
- Data is stored in a file `casper.txt` in the application's root directory.
- You can manually edit the `casper.txt` file, but be cautious as incorrect formats can lead to errors or data loss.
