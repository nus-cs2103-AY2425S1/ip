## Features

> **Note about command format:**
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` represent parameters you need to provide.
> - Commands like `list`, `bye` and `?` do not require any parameters. 
> - Providing extra parameters will result in an invalid command.  
>   - For example, entering `list 123` is incorrect and will not work.
> - Keep to 1 spacing strictly between words.
> - All words are case-sensitive.
> - For all date-time, the input will be expecting the date-time format to be in `dd-MM-yyyy HHmm'hrs'`
>   - Example: `03-02-2025 1800hrs`
