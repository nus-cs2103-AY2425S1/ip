## Duplicate Task Detection

If you try to add a Task that already exists, the chatbot will notify you:
  ```
  Task added seems to already exist. Do you want to continue? [yes/no]
  ```

If you type `yes`, the task will remain as a duplicate task in the list.

If you type `no`, the duplicate task will be deleted.
