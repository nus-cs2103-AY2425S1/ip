## Notes on user input
1. The app is able to handle case insensetive commands. For example, if the user were to type `lIsT`, the app will
understand the command to be `list` as the chatbot aims to make the best effort in understanding the user's intent.
Hence, no error will be thrown and the command will be executed accordingly.
2. The app is able to handle multiple spaces between words and will default all multiple spaces to single space.
