Oh, and don't worry—I'll save your task list. you're welcome.

## Features List

### 1. Add Tasks
Four types of tasks, because why limit your chaos to just one?
- **todo**: Basic, no-frills task. Like the "I’ll totally do this tomorrow" type.
- **deadline**: For when you want to feel the pressure of procrastination and a looming date.
- **event**: A task with both a start and end date. Like that meeting you’ll sleep through.
- **after**: Because you want to do it **after** a certain date, when you're "totally free."

**Task Format**: `[Task Type] [Description] (Date, if applicable)`

#### Example Usage:
- **Adding a Todo Task:**
  ```
  todo Conquer the world

  ```
  i have dumped this nonsense on the list 
  [T][ ] Conquer the world

  ```
