Features:

## Adding Todos

Adds tasks that are without any deadlines or time periods, and are thus generic by nature.

Format: `todo <task description>`

Example:

`todo go Sungei Buloh for bird watching sometime`

The chatbot notifies the user when the task to be done is successfully added to the list and specifies the total number of current tasks.

```
Got it. I've added this task:
[T][ ] go Sungei Buloh for bird watching sometime
Now you have 14 tasks in the list.
```

## Adding deadlines

Adds a deadline to the chatbot, to be viewed later when needed.

Format: `deadline <task description> /by <yyyy-mm-dd>`

Example:

`deadline Finish software architecture project /by 2024-11-23`

The chatbot notifies the user when the deadline is successfully added to the list and specifies the total number of current tasks.

```
Got it. I've added this task:
[D][ ] Finish software architecture project (by: Nov 23 2024)
Now you have 14 tasks in the list.
```

## Adding Events

Adds tasks that have a specific period that they occur in i.e. events.

Format: `event <task description> /from <start day/date and time> /to <start day/date and time>`

Example:

`event project meeting /from Mon 2pm /to Mon 4pm`

The chatbot notifies the user when the event is successfully added to the list and specifies the total number of current tasks.

```
Got it. I've added this task:
[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: Mon 4pm)
Now you have 14 tasks in the list.
```

## Deleting Tasks

Deletes tasks from the list of tasks currently in the program.

Format: `delete <index>`

Example:

`delete 14`

The chatbot notifies the user if the event is successfully deleted and specifies the total number of current tasks.

```
Got it. I've deleted this task:
[T][ ] go Sungei Buloh for bird watching sometime
Now you have 13 tasks in the list.
```

## Marking tasks

Marks the specified task from the list of tasks currently in the program.

Format: `mark <index>`

Example:

`mark 14`

The chatbot notifies the user if the task is successfully marked as done in the system.

```
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[D][X] Finish feature specification (by: Sep 22 2024)
```

## Unmarking tasks

Unmarks the specified task from the list of tasks currently in the program.

Format: `unmark <index>`

Example:

`unmark 14`

The chatbot notifies the user if the task is successfully unmarked in the system.

```
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
[D][ ] Finish feature specification (by: Sep 22 2024)
```

## Finding tasks

Finds tasks that match the keywords given in the command. Note that the functions finds words individually,
rather than searching for the whole string.

Format: `find <keyword>`

Example: `find book`

The chatbot finds all existing entries that contain the word 'book' and displays them to the user.

```
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
1.[T][X] read book
2.[D][ ] return book (by: Jun 6 2012)
3.[T][X] read book again
4.[T][ ] borrow book
```

## Snoozing deadlines

Lets the user delay a task with a deadline to a new date.

Format: `snooze <index> /by <date as yyyy-mm-dd>`

Example: `snooze 2 /by 2012-06-07`

The chatbot notifies the user if the deadline is successfully snoozed in the system and specifies the total number of
current tasks.

```
Got it. I've snoozed this task:
[D][ ] return book (by: Jun 7 2012)
Now you have 13 tasks in the list.
```
