# Duke User Guide

Duke is a personal task management application that helps you keep track of your todos, deadlines, and events. With Duke, you can easily add, update, and manage your tasks through a simple command-line interface. Manage your tasks without removing your hands from the keyboard!

## Additional features
As programmers, we probably hate looking at bright things. The "Toggle Dark Mode" button allows users to toggle between a screen brighter than their future and a comfy dark interface.
