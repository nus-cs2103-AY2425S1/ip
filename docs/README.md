**Welcome to Luna!**

I'm here to help you keep track of your tasks effortlessly. 
Whether it's your daily to-do task, deadlines, or events, 
I can help you organize, store, and manage everything in one place. 
Just let me know what tasks you'd like me to save,
and easily show all your tasks so you won't forget to complete any tasks!

## Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION`, `TASK_DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `deadline return book`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `undo`) will be ignored.<br> 
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
* Commands are case-insensitive
