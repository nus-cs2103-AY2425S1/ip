# GLaDOS Chatbot User Guide

GLaDOS is a versatile chatbot for managing tasks, based off of the video game character in _Portal_. If you can type fast, GLaDOS can assist with your task management quickly and efficiently (albeit a little reluctantly). Additionally, following this theme of game characters, this GUI allows you to speak to her as if you were in a game, too!
