# Llama Project

This a chatbot named after the great land animal _Llama_. It is able to keep track of your tasks efficiently!
It is a desktop app for **managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the 
**benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, Llama can get your task management done faster 
than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

> ℹ️ Notes about the command format:
> 1. Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
 e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo borrow book`.
> 2. `DATE` must always be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`.
     e.g. in `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE`, it should be `deadline return book /by 2024-11-23 12:00`.
> 3. Parameters must be in the specified order.<br>
     e.g. if the command specifies `DESCRIPTION from/DATE`, it needs to follow this format strictly.
