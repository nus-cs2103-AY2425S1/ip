- Text-based
- Questionable learning curve
- _SUPER_ FAST to ~~crash~~ use (I'm kidding, it's Java. You only get that* in C)
  (_* - in both speed and stability aspects_)

All you need to do is:
1. Download it from [here](https://github.com/yadobler/ip/releases) (DID YOU CHECK THE SITE LINK?).
2. Double click it (honestly doesn't work for me. You're better off running `java -jar yappingbot.java`).
3. ???
4. Add your tasks!

Supported flags include:
```
--savefile <FILEPATH> define an alternate savefile path
        -s <FILEPATH> same as --savefile
        -c            Run CLI mode (fallback)
```

Did I mention it's **FREE**? (Free of Charge, Free of Dom)

# Usage

The following commands are availabe:

## Running the bot
If you are running the bot as such:

`java -jar yappingbot.jar`

You can add the following:
- `-c`: Use command line interface instead of GUI
- `-s SAVEPATH` denote a custom savefile path

---

## Commands in the bot:
Commands are typed as such:  

`VERB first-argument /FLAG value /FLAG value`  

Where `verb` refers to the command and `flag` refers to any possible flags. The order of the 
flags are not fixed, as long as the first argument proceeds the verb, and all non-optional 
arguments are provided. Each command has several aliases, and more can be added with the 
[`alias`](#alias) command.

**Example**:

`event I will be off /from 2023-12-25 /to 2024-1-1`

Results in a _Event_ task, titled "I will be off", with the start date as _"25th December 2023"_ 
and end date as _"1st January 2024"_.

---

### Alias
Adds a new alias for a command.
#### Verbs:
- `alias`
#### First argument:

- **No spaces allowed**
- *The existing command*
#### Second argument:
- **Required**
- **No spaces allowed**
- *The new alias that will run command*

---

### List
Lists all the tasks in the current filter
#### Verbs:
- `list`
- `print`
- `l`
#### Example:

#### Note:
If you have a filter, list will show the tasks matching the filter. Use [`reset`](#Reset) to remove
the filter and view the entire list. A filtered list will have the filter listed before the tasks.

---

### Reset
Resets the current view to show all tasks without filter.
#### Verbs:
- `reset`
- `r`
#### Example:
`reset`

---
### Exit
Exits the program and ends the bot.
#### Verbs:
- `bye`
- `exit`
- `:q`
#### Example:
`bye`
#### Note:
- On the GUI, the input will be disabled. The window can be closed after this.
- The bot saves the tasks to a savefile that is usually where the application was executed. This 
  can be used when launching the bot next time. See [Launching](#running-the-bot).

---

### Filter
Filters the task to show all tasks matching the given search. Searched fields include the dates 
and task titles.
#### Verbs:

#### First argument:

- Use [`reset`](#Reset) to remove the filter and view the entire list.
- To search for multiple matching criteria, repeat the command with new search terms:
```
find Chores
f 2024
```
This will result in a filtered list `'Chores' AND '2024'`

---

# Tinkering
If you're bored and want to stress yourself, look no further!

Clone this, and feel free to run it like this:

**CLI Mode:**
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Feel free to change this!
    // The original main method checks if an argument is passed and uses it instead.
    String savefile = "./savefile"; 

    YappingBot yp = new YappingBot(savefile);
    yp.start();
}
```

**GUI Mode:** (requires javafx)
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // MainGuiApplication currently looks in 
    // Launcher to retrieve the savefilePath
    //
    // To be updated in further commits
    Launcher.savefilePath = "./savefile";
    MainGuiApplication.launch(MainGuiApplication.class, args);
}
```
