## Features
> [!NOTE]
> Notes about input format:
> - Words in `UPPERCASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user
> - Order of arguments cannot be changed
> - Extra arguments will be interpreted as incorrect input

Here are a list of features that Bobby provides:
### Creating tasks
Create a todo task in the following format: `todo TASK_NAME DESCRIPTION`

Create a deadline task in the following format: `deadline TASK_NAME /by TASK_NAME DATE`
> [!NOTE]
> The `DATE` has to be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

Create an event task in the following format: `event TASK_NAME /from START /to END`

### List
List out all your tasks in with `list`

### Task completion
You can mark a task as completed by inputting `mark TASK_NUMBER`

you can also unmark a task by inputting `unmark TASK_NUMBER`

- `TASK_NUMBER` indicates the index of the task in `list`

### Removing Tasks
Remove any task with `delete TASK_NUMBER`
- `TASK_NUMBER` indicates the index of the task in `list`

### Finding matching tasks
If you want to related tasks, simply use `find KEYWORD` to display all the tasks related 
to `KEYWORD`

E.g: `find assignment` will display a list of tasks containing the word `assignment`
- `find` is case-sensitive. E.g: `Homework` and `homework` will not match
- Only full words will be matched

### Archiving
To archive a task, `archive TASK_NUMBER`
To view all your archived tasks, simply `listarchive`.
> [!TIP]
> Archive tasks after they are marked completed to prevent a very long list of tasks.

## Saving and Loading
The list of tasks are stored in `[JAR_FILE_LOCATION]/data.txt` and list of archived tasks are stored in 
`[JAR_FILE_LOCATION]/archive.txt`. When the app is start up, Bobby will load in the data from these files. 
If these files are not present, they will automatically be created. Upon any modifications, 
Bobby will auto save the files. There is no need to save manually.

> [!CAUTION]
> **CAUTION**: In the event if there is any need to edit the data files directly, it is important to follow the format 
> correctly or the application might not work as intended. It is therefore recommended to work with a
> backup copy instead.
