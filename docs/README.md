## Saving the data

Data is automatically saved every time you change the task list.

Data is stored in `taskList.txt` in `Data` folder.

This folder should be created when you launch the program
in the folder containing the program. An empty `taskList.txt` is created 
if the file is not found.

The data is loaded from `taskList.txt` every time the program is launched.

If `taskList.txt` is edited or corrupted, the program will not open and will give an error.
To fix the error, either edit `taskList.txt` to match the format it is stored as,
or delete the file altogether and the program will create an empty file when it is next launched.

## Duplicate tasks

Tasks with the same type and description(s) will not be added to task list.

If you want to create two similar tasks, please make sure the description is not the same.
