# BotManager User Guide

![Ui.png](Ui.png)

BotManager is a chatbot that will help you track and manage your tasks.

## Features

Notes about the command format:<br>

* Words in `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
e.g. in `todo <name>`, `<name>` is a parameter.

* The command format must be followed exactly, and all arguments must be in the order given.
* All dates have to be entered in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.
e.g. `2024-01-01`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## Saving data
Task data is automatically written to the data file after each command. There is no need to manually save data.

## Editing the data file
Task data is saved in a text file at `[JAR file location]/data/tasks.txt`. 
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the text file. <br>
<b>Note: BotManager will only load data in the valid format. All invalid data will be discarded in the next autosave. (i.e. after any command is ran)
