# MoiMoi User Guide

![Screenshot of the user interface.](Ui.png)

MoiMoi is a **desktop app designed for managing tasks,
optimized for efficient use through a Command Line Interface (CLI)**
while offering the advantages of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you're a fast typist, MoiMoi helps you manage tasks more quickly than traditional GUI-based apps.

## Getting started

1. Ensure that Java 17 is installed in your computer.
2. Download the jar file of the latest release, from [here](https://github.com/wkxcass/ip/releases/).
3. Move the jar file into an empty folder.
4. Open a command window in that folder (right-click on the folder, then select "Open in Terminal").
5. Run the command `java -jar "moimoi.jar"`.
