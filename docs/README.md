# Duck User Guide
![Duck Screenshot](Ui.png)

Duck is a personal assistant application for managing tasks. It allows you to keep track of to-do lists, deadlines, and events through simple text commands. Duck supports a range of commands to help you manage and sort your tasks effectively, and can also save and load your tasks from a file.


## Notes about command format:
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. 
<br>e.g., in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter that can be used as `todo read book`.


- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored.
  <br>e.g., if the command specifies `list 123`, Duck will still execute the `list` command.

## Getting help with commands: `help`

The `help` command provides a list of all available commands and their descriptions. This can help you learn how to use Duck effectively.

2. deadline <description> /by <date> - Add a deadline task
3. event <description> /from <date> /to <date> - Add an event task
4. list - List all tasks
5. sort /target <target> /by <criterion> - Sort target tasks by the criterion
6. mark <task number> - Mark a task as done
7. unmark <task number> - Mark a task as incomplete
8. delete <task number> - Delete a task

```

## Listing all tasks: `list`

The `list` command allows you to view all tasks currently stored in Duck's task list, including to-do items, deadlines, and events.

**Format:** `list`

**Expected outcome**
```dtd
Quack, here are the tasks in your list:

3. [E][ ] team meeting (from: Sep 29 2024 10:00 to: Sep 29 2024 12:00)
```

## Adding to-do tasks: `todo`

The `todo` command allows you to add basic to-do tasks to your list. These tasks do not have a deadline or time constraints but are tasks that need to be completed.

**Format:** `todo DESCRIPTION`
- `DESCRIPTION` is the description of the task you want to add.

**Example:**  
`todo read book`

- This command adds a new to-do task called "read book" to your task list.

**Expected outcome**
```dtd
Got it. I've added this task:
[T][ ] read book
4 tasks in the list now.
```

## Adding deadlines: `deadline`

The `deadline` command allows you to add tasks with a deadline to your task list. You can specify the task description, followed by the `/by` keyword and the deadline.

**Format:** `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE`
- `DESCRIPTION` is the description of the task you want to add.
- `DATE` is the deadline for the task in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HHMM` or `YYYY/MM/DD HHMM`.

**Example:** `deadline submit assignment /by 2024-09-30 2359`

- This command adds a new deadline task called "submit assignment" with a deadline of September 30, 2024, at 11:59 PM.

**expected output**
```
Got it. I've added this task: 
[D][ ] submit assignment (by: Sep 30 2024 23:59) 
5 tasks in the list now.
```

## Adding events: `event`

The `event` command allows you to add an event to your task list. You can specify a description, a start time (using the `/from` keyword), and an end time (using the `/to` keyword).

**Format:** `event DESCRIPTION /from START_DATE /to END_DATE`
- `DESCRIPTION` is the description of the event you want to add.
- `START_DATE` is the start date and time of the event in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HHMM` or `YYYY/MM/DD HHMM`.
- `END_DATE` is the end date and time of the event in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HHMM` or `YYYY/MM/DD HHMM`.

**Example:**  
`event team meeting /from 2024-09-29 10:00 /to 2024-09-29 12:00`

- This command adds a new event called "team meeting" scheduled from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on September 29, 2024.

**Expected outcome:**
```dtd
Got it. I've added this task:
[E][ ] team meeting (from: Sep 29 2024 10:00 to: Sep 29 2024 12:00)
6 tasks in the list now.
```

## Marking tasks as done: `mark`

Duck allows you to mark tasks as completed using the `mark` command. This updates the status of a task in your list.

**Format:** `mark INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the task you want to mark as done.
```dtd
Note: The index starts from 1, not 0.
```
**Example:**  
`mark 2`

- This command marks the second task in your list as completed.

**Expected outcome:**
```dtd
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[D][X] CS2103T submission (by: Sep 30 2024 23:59)
```

## Marking tasks as not done: `unmark`

The `unmark` command allows you to mark tasks as not done.

**Format:** `unmark INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the task you want to mark as not done.
```dtd
Note: The index starts from 1, not 0.
```
**Example:**  
`unmark 1`

- This command marks the second task in the list as not done.

**Expected outcome:**
```dtd
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
[T][ ] read book
```

## Deleting tasks: `delete`

You can remove tasks from your list using the `delete` command.

**Format:** `delete INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the task you want to delete.
```dtd
Note: The index starts from 1, not 0.
```
**Example:**  
`delete 3`

- This command deletes the third task from the list.

**Expected outcome:**
```dtd
Noted. I've removed this task:
[T][X] water the plants
4 tasks in the list now.
```

## Finding tasks by keyword: `find`

The `find` command allows you to search for tasks containing a specific keyword.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD`
- `KEYWORD` is the word you want to search for in your tasks.

**Example:**  
`find assignment`

- This command lists all tasks that contain the keyword "assignment".

**Expected outcome:**
```dtd
Quack, I found these related tasks for you!
1. [D][ ] submit assignment (by: Sep 30 2024 23:59)
```

## Sorting tasks: `sort`

Duck supports sorting your tasks with the `sort` command. You can specify different criteria for sorting.

**Format:** `sort /target TARGET /by CRITERION`
- `TARGET` is the target tasks you want to sort (e.g., all, todo, deadline, event).
- `CRITERION` is the criterion you want to sort by (e.g., type, description, deadline, start, end).

**Example:**  
`sort /target all /by type`

- This command sorts all the tasks with deadlines in your list, in chronological order.

**Expected outcome:**
```dtd
all tasks sorted successfully by type!
```

**Previous list**
```dtd
Quack, here are the tasks in your list:
1. [T][ ] read book
2. [D][ ] submit assignment (by: Sep 30 2024 23:59)
3. [E][ ] team meeting (from: Sep 29 2024 10:00 to: Sep 29 2024 12:00)
4. [D][ ] CS2103T submission (by: Sep 30 2024 23:59)
5. [T][X] water the plants
```
**List after sorting**
```dtd
Quack, here are the tasks in your list:
1. [T][ ] read book
2. [T][X] water the plants
3. [D][ ] CS2103T submission (by: Sep 30 2024 23:59)
4. [D][ ] submit assignment (by: Sep 30 2024 23:59)
5. [E][ ] team meeting (from: Sep 29 2024 10:00 to: Sep 29 2024 12:00)
```

## Exiting the application: `bye`

You can exit Duck by using the `bye` command.

**Format:**  
`bye`

**Expected outcome:**
```dtd
Quack! Duck is going to sleep now. Goodbye!
```

## Saving the data
There is no need to save the data manually. Duck automatically saves your tasks to a file named `duck.txt` in a folder named data, in the user's home directory. 
The data will be loaded automatically the next time you run Duck.

## Editing the data file
Duck data are saved automatically as a txt file in the data folder of the user's home directory. 
Advanced users can edit the data file directly to make changes to the tasks.

```dtd
For Windows: C:\Users\<username>\data\duck.txt
For Mac: /Users/<username>/data/duck.txt
For Linux: /home/<username>/data/duck.txt
```

```dtd
Caution: Editing the data file directly with invalid formats may cause Duck to behave unexpectedly.
Duck will only load the lines of data that are in the correct format.
```
