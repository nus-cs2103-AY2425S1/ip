# Elysia User Guide

### Notes about the command format:

- Words in ``UPPER_CASE`` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
   - e.g. in todo TASK, TASK is a parameter which can be used as todo read book.
- For deadline command and event command, the input date will be assumed to be in the current year.
    - For example, "23 Sep" will be interpreted as "23 Sep 2024," since it is currently 2024.
- Enter the year explicitly if the date is not in the current year, such as "23 Sep 2025."
- Elysia does not allow tasks with deadlines in the past or events that start in the past.

**Important**
> Use ``23 Sep`` as the input date instead of ``23Sep`` for deadline and event commands.
