JEFF unclutters your brain from all the important tasks that you have to remember, so you can fill it with _useless memes_ instead. JEFF is
- fast
- reliable
- always at your side
- **ALWAYS** at your side
  ~~beware the chatbot, for it hides in your walls.~~

## JEFF features:
- [x] Manage your tasks
- [x] Manage your deadlines
- [ ] Manage your life (***COMING SOON***)


To all my fellow Java Programmers, you can clone my [repo](https://github.com/shardhrv/ip) and run the bot for yourself by running the `main` function that looks like
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
        new JEFF().run();
}
```
