## Introduction

Meet Puke ðŸ¤®, your loyal yet slightly tipsy sidekick dedicated to managing tasks. Whether you're slightly inebriated or fully sober, Puke ensures you never forget the important stuffâ€”like keeping the party going or remembering to pay your dues. Puke is characterized by its:

- **Text-based interface:** Simple commands, ideal even when your vision is a bit fuzzy.
- **User-friendliness:** Easy enough to use even on your rowdiest nights.
- **Rapid responses:** Quicker than a bartender's pour!

## Getting Started

Just let Puke handle your task management while you manage the fun. And remember, it's **completely free!**

### Quick Start

1. **Ensure Java 17 or higher is installed on your computer.**
2. **Download the latest .jar file from [here](https://github.com/iamdiluxedbutcooler/ip/releases/tag/A-Release).**
3. **Place the file in your desired location.**
4. **Open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the .jar file, and run:**

   ```
   java -jar puke.jar
   ```

   The GUI will pop up faster than you can say, "Bottoms up!"
