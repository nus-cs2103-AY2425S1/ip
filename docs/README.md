# Commands
Commmands are not case sensitive so eg. "todo" and "ToDo" are both valid

Most commands follow the format `[command] <additional info>` without any of the brackets

Note that commands are read as the first string of letters before a white space

## Command Summary

| Command  | Format, Example                                                                                                               |

## Adding tasks
#### Adding TODOs: `todo`

Use this command to help you add a TODO item to the task list.

Command: `todo <name_of_TODO_item>`

Example: `todo Finish 2100 Lab 3`

#### Adding DEADLINEs: `deadline`

Use this command to help you add a DEADLINE to the task list.

Command: `deadline <name_of_DEADLINE> /by <Additional info>`

Example: `deadline finish README /by Tomorrow`

#### Adding EVENTs: `event`

Use this command to help you add an EVENT to the task list.\
/to and /from can be used in either order

Command: `event <name_of_EVENT> /from <Additional info> /to <Additional info>`

Example: `event recess week /from Now /to Forever` or `event recess week /to Forever /from Now`

## Date formats
For `Event` and `Deadline` there are a few Acceptable input formats which you can use for the additional info that will automatically be recognised and converted into 
```LocalDates``` dates in the task itself instead of being stored as a String.

You can use any of the following: yyyy-MM-dd, yyyy.MM.dd, dd-MM-yyyy, dd.MM.yyyy \
Or you can simply input the day itself (e. thursday) or it's shorthand (eg. mon) which will be recognised as the next valid date which that day occurs (if you tyhpe today's day of the week it will  return today).


Example: Let's say today is 20th Sep 2024 then
`Event Carnival /from tues /to 2024-09-27`\
would return the Event `[E][ ] Carnival (From: 24 Sep 2024 to: 27 Sept 2024)`
