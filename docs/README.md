   - Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   - If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 17** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.

- `add deadline ASG1 2022-12-12` - Adds a deadline task called "ASG1" with end date "2022-12-12"
- `add event ASG1 2022-12-12 2022-12-22` - Adds an event task called "ASG1" 
with "2022-12-12", "2022-12-22" being start and end dates respectively

Note that dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format

### Marking/Unmarking a task: `mark`/`unmark`

Marks or unmarks an added task where `TASKNUMBER` is the number of task displayed in `list`.

Format: `mark TASKNUMBER`
Format: `unmark TASKNUMBER`
