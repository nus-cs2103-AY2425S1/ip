The Elon chatbot is a tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. 
It allows users to create, track, and organise tasks in various categories: todos, deadlines, and events. 
Key features include adding, deleting, finding, snoozing and marking tasks as complete.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest `elon.jar` file.
3. Copy the file to the folder you wish to use as the home folder for Elon.
4. Open a command terminal, navigate (`cd`) to the folder containing the jar file, 
and run the following command: (`java -jar elon.jar`)
5. A terminal interface will appear, ready to accept your commands.

Some example commands you can try:
- `list` : Lists all tasks.
