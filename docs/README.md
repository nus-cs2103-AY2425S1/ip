> - Words in single quotation mark `''` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  The parameters should follow the guide in the single quotation mark.<br>
  e.g. in `Todo 'Description'`, `'Description` is a parameter which can be used as `Todo Sleep`.
> - Extra arguments in most of the commands type will be interpreted as wrong format error.

 Now you have 1 tasks in the lists.
```

### 4. Find matching tasks

`Find dinner lunch`

```
  Oke. Here are the task that match the keywords:
  3. [E] [ ] dinner with crush (from: Sep 22 2024, 7:00 PM to: Sep 22 2024 8:00 PM)
```
The response can be interpreted as follows:
- Event type (`T` is a Todo, `E` is an Event and `D` is a deadline)
- Status (`[X]` for completed, `[ ]` otherwise)
- Description
- Start and end dates (if applicable) in `MMM d yyyy, h:mm a` format

## FAQ

**Q**: What if I type `Help` to the chatBot more than 2 times without closing the Help Window?<br>
**A**: Only one HelpWindow is opened. Second `Help` command won't open second Help Window.<br> 
**Q**: Where can I can the hard disk (cache) that stores all the data of my tasks? <br>
**A**: You should find a file name `Nah.txt` in the directory that you store the program (e.g : `C:\Users\Dell\Nah.txt`)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Known issues

1. **Command Overwriting**, If users attempt to add a task with the same description as an existing one, the app does not prevent duplicates. Users should manage their tasks accordingly.
2. **GUI resizing**, User should not resize the screen windows, as this version has not supported this.
