## Adding deadlines

Adding a deadline creates a task with a specified due date. The deadline is tracked, and Pro Yapper will display it in your list of tasks along with the due date.

Usage: `deadline <task description> /by <yyyy-MM-dd HHmm> /priority <priority level>`

Example: `deadline IP Submission /by 2024-09-20 2359 /priority high`

Outcome: Creates a task with a deadline and the specified priority. The task will be added to the list of tasks, and a confirmation message will be shown.

A to-do task is a basic task with no specific time attached to it. It allows you to create general tasks that need to be completed.

An event task is used to represent tasks with a specific start and end time. It allows you to define a period for an event.

Usage: `event <task description> /from <yyyy-MM-dd HHmm> /to <yyyy-MM-dd HHmm> /priority <priority level>`

Example: `event Meeting with TP group /from 2024-09-19 1500 /to 2024-09-19 1700 /priority high`
