![Product screenshot](./Ui.png)

**Lict**  is a chatbot that helps users organize and manage tasks effectively.
These tasks are stored locally, allowing users to maintain their task lists even after restarting the application.

## Setting up
**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have **Java 17** or above installed in your computer.

To check your Java version, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
java --version
```

1. Download the `Lict.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/yockcheng/ip/releases/tag/A-Release).
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Lict chatbot.
3. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, 
and use the `java -jar Lict.jar` command to run the application. 
A GUI similar to the picture shown above should appear in a few seconds. 

## Features

```

#### 1.2. Deadline

- **Unmark**: Resets a specific task's completion status to not done.
- **Snooze**: Reschedules a deadline or event by setting a new due date or start/end time.
- **Delete**: Remove a specific task from the task list permanently.

The mark command allows users to mark a task at a specified index as completed.

```

    [T][X] read book
```

#### 2.2. Unmark

The unmark command allows users to unmark a task previously marked as done.

## 4. Saving / Loading
Lict automatically saves the data in a .txt file after any commands that changes the data, 
such as adding, deleting or modifying tasks. The saved data is then loaded from the file when
the chatbot is started, and any corrupted data will be discarded.

The file is saved in the following location:

```
/data/LictData.txt
```

If the file or directory does not exist, Lict will create them automatically.
