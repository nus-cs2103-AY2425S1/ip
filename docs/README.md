Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[T][X] Buy bread

```
OK! I've marked this task as not done:
[T][ ] Buy bread
```

OK, I've removed this task:
[T][ ] Buy bread

## Delete ALL tasks

Reset your list by deleting ALL the tasks. Do this at your own risk!

Example:

```
reset
```

Bob will respond with:

```
OK, I've removed all your tasks.
```

---

## Find certain tasks

Find tasks by searching a keyword from their description.
