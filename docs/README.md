## Saving the data
Ponder Pika helps you to save data automatically while we exit the program.
It helps you from the effort and time to save it manually!:+1:

## Known Issues
1. **When entering a duplicate task**, currently it does not allow and throws a DuplicateTaskException. 
However, it should allow for deadline and event where description could be same but dates and time are different.
2. **Send button overlaps** a bit of user input text field if window not widened.
