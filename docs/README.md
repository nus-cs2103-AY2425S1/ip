All you need to do is,

2. run `java -jar neuro.jar` (as of now, double clicking does not work ðŸ˜¢)

If you are a Java programmer, you can use it to practice Java too. Here's the `main` method:
```Java
public class Neuro {
    // Some other helper methods...

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Neuro("data/Neuro.txt").run();
    }
}
```

The character of "Neuro" in this project is inspired by the AI streamer [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama).
