### JavaDocs

**Tool used:** ChatGPT

**What I did:** I used ChatGPT to refine the JavaDocs that I had written for the methods and\
classes.

**Time saved:** It saved a considerable amount of time as it was able to refine the JavaDocs 
for all the methods a lot faster than if I did it manually. Manually I would have taken at least 
2 hours, but with ChatGPT I took around 1 hour.
