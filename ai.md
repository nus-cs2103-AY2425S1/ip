What I have used AI for
1. I write down my implementation of the question, and then ask the AI model design questions about the code
2. For example, the first time I wrote my Orion class it was long winding and not very modular
3. So, I asked Claude Sonnet for suggestions on how to improve it, and it told me I should follow the "Single Responsibility principle"
4. I then searched about it on Google (and then read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle), and decided to refactor my code to fix it.
5. Used AI to understand file I/O in Java and use for my function (after giving it pseudocode)

### Other Minor Things I used it for
1. Understanding various Java features I had forgotten / not known (Overriding rules learnt in CS2030s, packages)
2.
