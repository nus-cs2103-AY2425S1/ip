                        To create a new task, first choose a task type:

                        1. Todo - No end date
                        2. Deadline - Has end date
                        3. Event - Has start and end date

                        Then do either :
                        Todo - add <name>
                        Deadline - add <name> | <deadline date>
                        Event - add <name> | <start date> | <end date>

                        Other commands:
                        help            displays this page
                        list            lists all tasks available
                        mark <index>    mark a task as completed
                        unmark <index>  mark a task as incomplete
                        remove <index>  remove task from list
                        find <keyword>  find keyword in list
                        bye             exit program
                        """;
    }
}
