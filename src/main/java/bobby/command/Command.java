/**
 * The {@code Command} enum represents the set of valid commands that the application
 * can interpret and execute. Each enum constant corresponds to a specific action
 * that the user can request, such as adding a task, marking a task as done, or exiting the application.
 * <p>
 * This enum provides a method, {@code fromString}, to convert user input into the corresponding
 * {@code Command} enum constant. If the input string does not match any recognized command,
 * the {@code UNKNOWN} constant is returned.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class helps in categorizing and processing user commands in a structured way, making the
 * input handling process in the application more efficient and easier to manage.
