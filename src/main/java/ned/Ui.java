/**
 * The {@code Ui} class handles the user interface of the application by managing interactions with the user.
 * It is responsible for displaying messages and prompts, as well as reading input commands from the user.
 * Messages are formatted and presented as dialogue from "Ned," adding a thematic element to the user experience.
 *
 * <p>This class maintains an internal list of dialogue lines, {@code builtUpNedDialogue}, which accumulates messages
 * to be displayed to the user in a consolidated format. The method {@link #getAllBuiltUpDialogue()} concatenates
 * these messages and prepares the dialogue for output, ensuring that each interaction is presented cohesively.
 *
 * <p>Key functionalities include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Adding messages related to task additions and removals via {@link #addTasksToNedDialogue(Task, int)} and
 *       {@link #removeTasksToNedDialogue(Task, int)}.</li>
 *   <li>Displaying welcome and farewell messages through {@link #getWelcomeMessage()} and {@link #getByeMessage()}.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>Showing error messages and command usage information with {@link #showLoadingError()} and
 *       {@link #getCommandMessage()}.</li>
 *   <li>Reading user input from the console using the {@link #readCommand()} method.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The class also handles message formatting, including indentation and incorporating an ASCII art logo to enhance
 * the visual presentation. By centralizing the user interface logic, the {@code Ui} class ensures a consistent and
 * engaging user experience throughout the application.
