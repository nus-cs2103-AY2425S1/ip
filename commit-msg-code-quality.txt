Improve code quality.

- TaskList class: contains some common behaviors while processing storage for different tasks.
- TaskList class: Methods are not adhering with logical structure.
- Storage class: Else branch is used for task type = 'D'

The common behaviors cause code duplication, lines without logical structure 
will affect clarity.The 'else' branch should not be used when the condition can be specified.

- Let's pull up behaviors common to all tasks into a new method named addingTaskAcknowledgement.
- Let's add some black lines to separate groups of related statements  
- Let's use the 'else' branch for catch error and move the 'D' task into if-else branch.
