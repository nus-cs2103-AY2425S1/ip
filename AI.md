# Usage of Artificial Intelligence
ChatGPT 4o was rather useful in improving my productivity when doing this IP in a few ways:


1. GPT can write decent javadocs.
    - GPT was able to understand my Java class and write a comprehensive javadoc for each class
    - A significant amount of time was saved by using this approach
    - Reading the documentation that GPT generated also helped to reinforce my understanding of each class and method.

2. GPT can format code really well.
    - Instead of manually adding line breaks arduously to conform to code style, GPT was able to format a whole block of code in an instance.

3. GPT can write many basic tests
    - Whilst a human is still needed to write good tests, GPT was able to generate a much larger number of tests for the basic operations of the code

4. GPT is useful in changing the design of the GUI
    - Instead of manually trying out different color combinations to find a pleasing one, GPT was able to suggest a decent color palette with a few prompts. I found this extremely useful.
