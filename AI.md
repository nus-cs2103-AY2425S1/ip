# AI Usage
## AI in coding:
- Used ChatGpt and Copilot to generate JavaDocs
    - Prompt: "Generate JavaDocs for the following code"
    - Observation: Generated a lot of JavaDocs that I would have to manually write. It saved probably many hours!

- Used Copilot to auto complete the code
    - Observation: The code generated is not always correct, but it gives a good starting point. It is also useful to see how the AI thinks about the problem. Even this message is generated by Copilot! üòÅ

- Used Copilot to auto complete test cases code
    - After writing some test cases on my own, I used Copilot to generate similar test cases.

## AI in resources:
- Used Canva AI to create DaDuck and DaUser image
  - Prompt: "Cute yellow cartoon duck profile picture"
  - Prompt: "puzzled student profile picture"
  - Observation: Saved me a lot of time trying to find free resources online!
