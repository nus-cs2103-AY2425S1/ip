# Intro
Hello there! I am using GitHub CoPilot for my individual project.
Will update this AI.md file soon!

### Update (21/8/2024):
GitHub copilot helped a lot with autocomplete and suggestions.
It was spot on except for a few things such as the scanner and my personalised messages.
Overall I would say it cut time for me, but I could still just hardcode everything by myself.

### Update(22/8/2024):
I am the one settling all the logic and methods for the project, 
GitHub CoPilot is just helping me with the autocomplete and saving a lot of time.
I would say around 50% of the code was autocompleted by CoPilot, even though it is code that I understand and would have written myself.
One thing that went well was that GitHub CoPilot helped me with the response to the "help" command.
On the other hand, it was not able to help with personalised messages, so I had to write them myself.

### Update(30/8/2024):
GitHub Copilot helped to autocomplete the code for updating storage and reading storage. Main logic is still by me.

### Update(31/8/2024):
GitHub Copilot helped to autocomplete almost all the JavaDocs.

### Update(18/9/2024):
Thank you so much GitHub Copilot for helping me with the project. It was a great experience using it to autocomplete code.
Sometimes GitHub Copilot would suggest code that was not needed, but it was still helpful in saving time.
