Use #1

I handcoded my solution for Level-0 to Level-6 (Week 2 requirements).
After passing the testing phase, I decided my solution had become too verbose after the 6 iterations.

I passed my code to ChatGPT and asked it to identify ways for me to shorten my code. It was able to identify existing
Java methods which did away with some of my loops. It also identified repetition in my code (in particular,
the method "parseTaskNumber" consolidates repetitions) and helped me update my 
"switch" statement to the latest Java version which is less verbose.

Since my code was already functional, this use did not save a tremendous amount of time for this week's activities.
However, I imagine it would come in handy as I continue to build the codebase.
