## Use of AI Tools in the Project

* **GitHub Copilot** to auto-generate code snippets in some methods to save time.
* **ChatGPT** to generate the task description for the task, `Parser` class, and unit tests.

## What Works Well

**GitHub Copilot** is a great tool for generating code snippets for methods that are not implemented yet. It saves time
and helps to understand the code better. For example, the parser method to extract the task description from the input
string was generated by GitHub Copilot.

**ChatGPT** is a great tool for generating the task description for the task and `Parser` class. It saves time and helps
to understand the code better. For example, the parser method to extract the task description from the input string was
generated by ChatGPT. The tool is also very helpful for generating unit tests for the project. Javadoc is also generated
using ChatGPT.
