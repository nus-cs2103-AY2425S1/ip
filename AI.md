# AI Tool Usage and Observations

This file serves as a record of my use of AI tools and my observations regarding their effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.

Tool: GitHub Copilot
- With the copilot as a vscode extension it was really easy to use. No need to click away from the code editor
- Useful for writing boilerplate code. For example, when declaring a constructor, it would automatically definte the required parameters and store them accordingly. 
- Not so useful when trying to large chunks of code. 
- Super useful for writing documentation. Especially JavaDoc annotations of params, and exceptions which are straightforward to add, but tedious work.
