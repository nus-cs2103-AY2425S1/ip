Tools used:
- Github Copilot
- ChatGPT-4o

What worked:
- Decreased time spent on writing code, as the autofill feature of Github Copilot was able to generate code snippets for me.
- ChatGPT-4o was able to provide me with information on OOP design advice, which helped me understand the topic better.
- Managed to adhere to OOP right at the start, which saved time in the long run.

What didn't work:
- ChatGPT was not able to understand the context of the code I was writing, so it was not able to provide me with relevant information at times.
- Github Copilot sometimes generated code that was not optimized or efficient, which required me to refactor the code later.
- Github Copilot was able to generate code based on context from my code, but it was not always accurate or relevant.

General thoughts
- Using AI tools is still extremely helpful as they saved me a lot of time. However, they are not perfect and require human intervention to ensure the quality of the code.
