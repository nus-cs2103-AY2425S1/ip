# Documenting the use of AI tools in this project

## Introduction
I have done quite an extensive bit of coding myself in many languages and while I have a decent amount of experience
in writing code, I mostly worked in iterative depth first approaches or sequential approaches. I also rarely was
involved in automated testing. As such I am trying my best to keep the use of AI tools to a minimum. However, I do
recognise that it is an important tool for reducing repeated tasks such as creating similar code mainly for formatting
and parsing inputs in the UI. As such, I have created this file to document all of my uses of AI that are more
widespread.

## What was AI Used for?
Mainly AI was used in the debugging of longer methods in the initial coding process.
Some non-trivial methods were also auto-completed with minor edits in my earlier iterations (of course the logic was
thought of by myself).
Then as I refactored everything, I started to use AI to simplify logic that I already had in the code, while of course
trying to update the things I could easily see from the course details by myself.
A great chunk of time was saved by using ChatGPT for creating JavaDocs and planning JUnit Test Cases.


## How was the experience?
There was some level of difficulty of understanding how to "game" the AI into giving me code consistent with the logic
I have in mind. As I used AI more, I noticed there were some inconsistencies and "bullying" the AI does not always work
(even if it mostly does). Sometimes giving old code as example helps provide the AI with a lot more context to actually
do the work.

For Javadocs and JUnit tests, the AI provides a solid template to work with saving a huge chunk of time.


## Conclusion
Overall, I think I learnt a lot of shortcuts as well when using AI, since it sometimes uses functions I would have never
thought of and this exposure makes my coding knowledge stronger (even if the method spit out by the AI is not always
correct, the debugging helps a lot).
