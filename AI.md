A-MoreTesting
- used Githhub Copilot extension to write test cases
- these test cases were generic test cases
- although it helped to save time, there were quite a number of tests that failed due to improperly formatted inputs
- use of Copilot saved time writing trivial code, but still needed to go through and correct / finetune

A-JavaDoc
- also used Copilot to help with writing JavaDoc
- had to correct output to be more in line with the standards set
