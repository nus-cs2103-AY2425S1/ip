# Use of AI tools in the project

* **GitHub Copilot** to auto-generate code snippets in some methods to save time
* **ChatGPT** to generate the task description for the task and Parser class

## What works well

**GitHub Copilot** is a great tool to generate code snippets for methods that are not implemented yet. It saves time
and helps to understand the code better. For example, the parser method to extract the task description from the input
string was generated by GitHub Copilot.

**ChatGPT** is a great tool to generate the task description for the task and Parser class. It saves time and helps to
understand the code better. For example, the parser method to extract the task description from the input string was
generated by ChatGPT.
